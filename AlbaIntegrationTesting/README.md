# AlbaIntegrationTesting

This sample demonstrates the usage of [Alba](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba) against
a web service API written with ASP.Net Core MVC

There are two projects:

1. WebApplication - a tiny sample ASP.Net Core application generated by `dotnet new webapi`
   and the addition of a small `AdditionController` as a sample
2. WebApplication.Testing - a small project generated with the `dotnet new xunit` template
   that demonstrates the usage of Alba with [xUnit.Net](https://xunit.github.io) and [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly)
   
There is no special setup, and you can run the Alba specifications in `DoMathSpecs` as soon as you open the solution in the IDE of your choice.
